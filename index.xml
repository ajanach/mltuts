      <description>Intro Are you interested in learning how to use Python to analyze and visualize data? In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the process of loading and manipulating the iris dataset, calculating mean, maximum and minimum values, and splitting the data into training and test sets. We&amp;rsquo;ll also show you how to display unique data and use visualizations, such as pie charts and graphs, to better understand the data. All the code in this post is written in Python, using modules like sklearn and matplotlib.</description>

      <title>04 - K-means Clustering</title>
      <link>http://mltuts.online/ml/04-k-means-clustering/</link>

      <guid>http://mltuts.online/ml/04-k-means-clustering/</guid>
      <description>Intro In unsupervised machine learning, clustering is a popular technique used to group similar data points. One of the most widely used clustering algorithms is K-means. K-means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data points into k distinct clusters. In this blog post, we will explore the K-means algorithm and its implementation in Python using the scikit-learn and yellowbrick libraries. We will cover how to train the model, predict clusters, find centroids, and visualize the results using scatter plots, silhouette visualizations, and K-elbow methods.</description>

      <guid>http://mltuts.online/ml/03-olivetti_faces-and-number-generating/</guid>
      <description>Intro In the world of data analysis, exploring diverse datasets and understanding their patterns and visual representations is crucial. In this blog post, we will embark on an exciting journey of analyzing the Olivetti Faces dataset, a collection of facial images, and delve into generating random numbers for further analysis. We will utilize Python and several powerful modules, such as sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib, to accomplish these tasks.
Olivetti Faces: Firstly, we will start by loading the Olivetti Faces dataset using the fetch_openml function.</description>

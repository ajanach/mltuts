      <guid>http://mltuts.online/ml/04-k-means-clustering/</guid>
      <description>Intro In unsupervised machine learning, clustering is a popular technique used to group similar data points. One of the most widely used clustering algorithms is K-means. K-means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data points into k distinct clusters. In this blog post, we will explore the K-means algorithm and its implementation in Python using the scikit-learn and yellowbrick libraries. We will cover how to train the model, predict clusters, find centroids, and visualize the results using scatter plots, silhouette visualizations, and K-elbow methods.</description>

      <guid>http://mltuts.online/ml/06-linear-regression/</guid>
      <description>Intro In this blog post titled &amp;ldquo;06 - Linear Regression,&amp;rdquo; the author explores the concept of linear regression and how it can be applied to real-world data. The post begins by fetching a dataset and converting it from pandas to numpy. The author then selects the independent and dependent variables and converts them from imperial to metric units. Next, a scatter plot of the data is displayed, followed by the training of a linear regression model.</description>

      <description>Examples of Clustering in Real Life Market Segmentation: Companies can use clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior or preferences. By segmenting customers into different groups, companies can tailor their marketing strategies to target each group more effectively.
Image Segmentation: Clustering can be used in image processing to segment images into different regions based on similarities in color, texture, or other features. This can be useful in various applications, such as object recognition, medical imaging, and remote sensing.</description>

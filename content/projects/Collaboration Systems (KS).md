## Description
This project involves exploring the capabilities of the Microsoft Office 365 platform. It demonstrates how to utilize the functionalities of the platform to meet the needs of companies that do not have access to on-premise infrastructure. The solution for such companies lies in Microsoft Office 365, which offers modern tools and collaboration. This project describes the process of registering a domain, configuring name servers, and creating a tenant for the company. Additionally, the functionalities of MS Office 365 like creating users using PowerShell, creating groups using PowerShell, Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and MS Teams are discussed. MS Teams functionality is performed on a Linux virtual machine using the CentOS 8.3 version, and OneDrive for Business is performed on a Windows 10 virtual machine.

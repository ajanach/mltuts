## Description
This masterâ€™s thesis presents a detailed comparison of two prominent orchestration systems for microservices applications: **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** and **K3S**. The objective is to evaluate the performance, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use of these tools by orchestrating a medium-complexity microservices application consisting of 15 microservices.

The thesis covers:
- Key factors to consider when selecting an orchestration system.
- Guidelines on when to use AKS vs K3S.
- Benchmarking the performance of orchestration systems.
- Estimating the costs of running microservices applications in the cloud versus on-premise.
- Basic knowledge about Kubernetes, AKS, and K3S.
- Using Terraform to deploy infrastructure in Azure.
- Automating the configuration and deployment of a K3S cluster with Ansible.
- Using YAML manifests to configure Kubernetes resources.
- Deploying Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring using Helm.

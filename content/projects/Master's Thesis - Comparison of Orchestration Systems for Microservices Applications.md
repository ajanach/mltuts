## Description
This masterâ€™s thesis presents a detailed comparison of two prominent orchestration systems for microservices applications: **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** and **K3S**. The objective is to evaluate the performance, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use of these tools by orchestrating a medium-complexity microservices application consisting of 15 microservices.

The research provides an in-depth guide on deploying infrastructure, application services, and system services in both AKS and K3S Kubernetes clusters, highlighting the strengths of each tool in different scenarios. The thesis also covers:

- Key factors to consider when selecting an orchestration system.
- Guidelines on when to use AKS vs K3S.
- Benchmarking the performance of orchestration systems.
- Estimating the costs of running microservices applications in the cloud versus on-premise.
- Basic knowledge about Kubernetes, AKS, and K3S.
- Using Terraform to deploy infrastructure in Azure.
- Automating the configuration and deployment of a K3S cluster with Ansible.
- Using YAML manifests to configure Kubernetes resources.
- Deploying Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring using Helm.

The thesis demonstrates the process of building, automating, and monitoring a microservices-based infrastructure and provides insights into the use cases where each orchestration system excels. It concludes with a discussion on whether AKS or K3S is more suitable based on performance benchmarks and operational costs.

## Description
This project involves setting up a domain, creating 50 users, and implementing a secondary DNS, DC and Storage Spaces with Dynamic Access Control file system. Additionally, a functional Distributed File System with replication is established, a CA and DHCP cluster is installed, IIS is set up with a test page using SSL/TLS encryption. NLB is also configured, a default gateway is set up and an internet connection is temporarily established to install a reverse proxy server. The project concludes by raising a Docker engine, downloading a Docker container and disabling the internet connection, and upgrading the server to the latest version.

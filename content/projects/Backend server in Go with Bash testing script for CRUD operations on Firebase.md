## Description
In this project, I've created a backend server using Golang, Firebase Admin, Gorilla, and Gocron. Also, I created a convenient bash script. Also, I created a bash script to enhance collaboration between frontend and backend developers. The script simplifies testing and demonstrates CRUD operations on the Firebase database, enabling frontend developers to interact with the backend effectively.

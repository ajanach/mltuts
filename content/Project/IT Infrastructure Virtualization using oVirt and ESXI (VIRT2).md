# Description

## oVirt part:
This project involves the installation and configuration of a Linux infrastructure using CentOS and KVM on a Windows host computer. It includes configuring network virtual adapters in KVM, installing four virtual machines, writing a script for manipulating virtual machines, setting up oVirt engine, adding nodes to the oVirt environment and configuring storage by creating NFS and iSCSI shares. The goal is to create a reliable and efficient virtualization environment.

## ESXI/vSphere part:
This project deals with the implementation and management of Linux and VMware infrastructure virtualization. It includes configuring and using two ESXi hypervisor computers and two Linux computers with CentOS operating system, configuring network adapters, setting up NFS and iSCSI file systems, adding the ESXi hypervisors to the vSphere datacenter using the vSphere Client, testing migration and creating a cluster, configuring "High Availability" and "Fault Tolerance" over the virtual switch, and enabling vMotion capabilities on the virtual switch.

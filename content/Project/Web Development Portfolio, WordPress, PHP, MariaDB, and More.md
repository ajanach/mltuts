## Description
In this project, I have successfully developed both a webshop and a presentation web page. Leveraging a versatile tech stack including WordPress, PHP, MariaDB, Apache/httpd, Google Analytics, SEO, and E-mail service integration, I have created a dynamic and engaging online presence for business. The webshop provides seamless e-commerce functionality, allowing customers to browse and purchase products with ease. The presentation web page showcases your brand, products, and services, captivating visitors with visually appealing designs and compelling content. With a focus on user experience and conversion optimization, I have implemented effective SEO strategies and integrated Google Analytics to track and analyze website performance. The result is a professional, user-friendly, and search engine optimized web presence that enhances your online visibility, drives sales, and effectively promotes business.

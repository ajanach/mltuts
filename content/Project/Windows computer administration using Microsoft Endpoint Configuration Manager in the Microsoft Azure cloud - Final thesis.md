## Description
The System Center Configuration Manager is a service designed for IT administrators that enables them to easily manage computers in a network where Windows operating systems are installed. This service allows for central distribution and updating of antivirus clients and pre-defined antivirus rules, installation and upgrading of business software applications, upgrading of operating systems, configuring user and server computers, installation of operating systems using images, central storage of information about hardware and software resources and implementation of general or group policies. Additionally, this service allows for monitoring of the proper functioning of individual modules of the system and tailored monitoring of specific computers in the network. This thesis will cover the principles of automation and the simplification of automation for a large number of computers in the network using the System Center Configuration Manager tool. It also covers how to set up the infrastructure from scratch with all the necessary requirements for the tool to function properly, as well as the working methods and capabilities of the tool itself. The thesis demonstrates how to administrate and automate the process of installing and upgrading applications according to specific requirements, as well as upgrading and installing the operating system using a created image on the desired computer or all the computers in the network. In conclusion, it is discussed whether the use of this tool in production infrastructures is worthwhile and if it truly simplifies the administration and automation of client computers in the network along with a description of potential related tools to the System Center Configuration Manager.

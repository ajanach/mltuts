## Description
This project aims to design and implement a complex IT infrastructure for a company, including deploying virtual machines at two locations and configuring services such as OpenVPN, iSCSI, FreeIPA, SMB, Web server, Mail server, ADDS, DNS, DHCP, NTP, RODC, storage spaces, Root CA and subordinate CA, failover cluster, DFS and IIS, and setting up network connections. The virtual machines will be deployed using Ubuntu 20.10, CentOS 8.3, Windows 2019 server and Windows server, and a Windows 10 desktop machine will be used for remote access and troubleshooting. The objectives of this module are to learn how to prepare, execute, and document complex IT projects, as well as recommend solutions based on requirements, implement complex network, server, and virtualization environments, implement infrastructure services, and document the project.

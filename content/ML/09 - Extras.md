2.  **Image Segmentation**: Clustering can be used in image processing to segment images into different regions based on similarities in color, texture, or other features. This can be useful in various applications, such as object recognition, medical imaging, and remote sensing.

3.  **Recommendation Systems**: Clustering can be used to group similar items or products based on customer preferences, ratings, or purchase history. This information can then be used to recommend products or services to customers who are likely to be interested in them.

4.  **Genomic Analysis**: Clustering techniques are widely used in bioinformatics to group genes or proteins based on their expression patterns or other characteristics. This can help researchers identify genes or proteins that are involved in specific biological processes or diseases, and develop targeted therapies or treatments.
